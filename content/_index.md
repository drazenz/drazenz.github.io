# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Drazen.

I'm an engineer, currently focusing on machine learning. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drazenzaric/)

On the side, I hack indie projects and sometimes write.

## Side Projects

#### Blogboard - https://blogboard.io

Blogboard is a curated index of engineering blogs with a search engine and weekly newsletter.

The tech behind it: A fine-tuned DistilBERT model to classify articles into topic, Elasticsearch for full-text search and _find similar documents_, Python/Flask/PostgreSQL for backend, VueJS/Vuetify for frontend. It all runs on a single $20 virtual server.

#### Upvote for Slack - https://upvote.chat

A simple polling app for Slack, with a slick UI and poll analytics features.

## Writing
